# Four Card Feature Section

A responsive four-card feature section, built with pure HTML and CSS as a challenge from Frontend Mentor.

## Description

This project is a solution to the "Four card feature section" challenge. The main objective was to build a clean and modern component with four feature cards. This project is an excellent demonstration of mastering layout techniques with **CSS Grid and Flexbox** and creating a fully responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes without the need for JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For creating the semantic structure of the page, including the header and the four feature cards.
* **CSS3:** For all the styling, including typography, colors, and especially for the sophisticated layout that changes from a single column on mobile to a more complex, multi-column grid on desktop.

## Installation

This is a static, pure frontend project. No complex setup or dependencies are required. Just follow these simple steps to get a local copy:

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to view the project.

## Usage

This project serves as a showcase of modern CSS layout capabilities. It displays a title, a subtitle, and four distinct feature cards, each with an icon and a brief description. The layout is optimized to look clean and organized on any device.

## Features

* **Grid-based Layout:** The four cards are arranged using a responsive grid system that changes based on the screen size.
* **Clean & Modern UI:** The design is minimal and professional, with subtle hover effects and a well-defined color palette.
* **Fully Responsive:** The layout seamlessly transitions between a mobile-friendly view and a desktop-optimized view.
